The fist demands.

The fist breaks.

The fist makes enemies who remember.

<br/>

The open hand provides.

The open hand waits.

The open hand makes servants

who forget they were ever free.

<br/>

Which is more terrible?

The blade you see coming,

or the kindness that drowns

you while you smile?
