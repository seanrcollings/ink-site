## What Must Be Sung

I fear this is a tale none shall ever know.

The Starwardens are deaf to my pleas. Their minds turn like the gears of a machine—always working towards their goal, but lacking in the compassion of our people. They do not sing like we once did. They speak of practical matters—of harvest yields and new birthing caves, of trade routes and territorial boundaries—as if the world had not been wounded at its very heart. When I try to share what I have learned, what I have seen through another's eyes, they turn away.

"Old sorrows," they say, "cannot save our people, cannot cause the dead to wake, cannot beat a new path for us to walk."

And yet, I sing this tale out into the silent Void regardless. The One, the true god, but even it is deaf and blind to my pleas as it is to all things that transpire within its expanse. A babe's cry is silence to the Void, swallowed in its depth. A lover's confession naught but a mote of dust on a single blade of grass at the end of infinity. It does not see, it does not know, it simply *is*.

Yet I sing.

Perhaps one day someone may hear my call, may understand the weight of these truths.

Perhaps not.

It must be sung all the same.

Yet this tale is not mine, for it came to me through another's pain. Once, many decades ago, a hooded stranger came to me—the first man of flesh and blood that I had seen since my eyes had turned to the sky and my body had changed for the final time. This hooded man intrigued me for he held no reverence in my presence and no fear at my form. The specks of starlight that chased each other through my body caught his attention, but not his awe. He watched them with interest, but without fervent worship. As if they were no more substantial than insects on a river's surface.

Strangest of all, his mind was silent to me. I could not hear his thoughts, could not know his name. In all my transformed existence, no consciousness had ever been hidden from me.

I reached to touch him, and he undid the clasp of his cloak. It fell from him and with it his guise as a simple wanderer. Eyes white as snow, carrying a depth and an age his face did not betray. He raised arms wrapped in bandages before him as if in benediction. But beneath those bandages burned a pale searing light, threatening to blind me.

From his arms stretched a thousand thousand minuscule threads of light. They flowed through the air in every direction, before disappearing into infinity.

"This is my burden," he whispered, "My shame. I can feel their weight, but cannot see their ends. I come to ask if you might see where I cannot."

Slowly I reached out a hand to one of the threads, then hesitated. I asked him what he thought might be found on the other end of these threads of light.

"Truth I expect", he replied, "Terrible truth."

I grasped a thread between two fingers, pulling it taut. I lifted another hand and plucked the string. It rang with a pure tone that emanated from everywhere and nowhere. The sound sunk deeply into my mind, and I felt a fragment of something form within me. A memory from long ago, long forgotten. The thread slowed then stilled, its vibrations ceasing, but the tone remained, echoing through my mind. With each thread I plucked, with each note I heard, another fragment arrived in my mind. They were disparate, unconnected at first, but as I continued to weave a song from this strange man's burden, I began to see the story unfold.

What I discovered in those threads was a tale of love turned to loss, mercy become destruction, and choices that echoed across worlds. This is that man's story, and the story of those he failed.
